# Motion Augmneted Reality Cards
These are Motion AR cards. Each card has a introduction to the movement printed on the back of it. There are a total of 6 set of motions that we are exploring in here :
* Round and Round
* Up and Down
* Rotation
* Round and Twisting Up
* Up and Down-short
* Sequential Up and Down

**We are using these 6 motion in combination or individually to obtain the desired movement.**

These cards can be scanned through Artivive app and the AR content will be revealed. The Ar content adds a layer of immersiveness.
The app is freely available for download on both playstore for Android and AppStore on iOS devices.

Since development of and AR app was not in the scope of the project, it was decided to use artivive for bringing in the AR capability. Also the app is easily available for download across platforms.
